I’m a PhD student in sociology at Duke University. I’m interested in the use of computational methods to study politics and culture. I hold an MA in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago and a BA in Psychology from Universidad de los Andes.

I was born and raised in Bogotá, Colombia, and like to cook in my free time.
