I’m a PhD student in sociology at Duke University.

I’m interested in the use of computational methods to study politics and culture. My research focuses on taking advantage of natural language processing to explore new ways of thinking about ideology, coalition

I hold an MA in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago and a BA in Psychology from Universidad de los Andes.

I was born and raised in Bogotá, Colombia, and like to [cook](https://www.instagram.com/fromrags.todishes/) in my free time.
